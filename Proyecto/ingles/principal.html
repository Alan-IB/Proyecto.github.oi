    <p><br>Recommended for those older people who enjoy movies and series of heroes like a child, DC Comics gives us darker movies
    than Marvel Studios. DC Comics has two small universes(One
    in the Netflix series and another on the big screen) that have been loved and hated by many, the universe of
    the big screen is not as well posed and firm as that of its rival Marvel Studios, it still lacks much that
    tell and say but despite this DC creates a great atmosphere with each movie and series.</p>

    <p><br> Those who enjoy the classic heroes, the typical good guy who always does the right thing to do everything
    the rest, Marvel Studios has a great cinematic universe that with each movie and series goes away
    expanding every time more and more. Marvel Studios has series on netflix and disney + but which by the
    at the moment only disney+ series are canonical.</p>
