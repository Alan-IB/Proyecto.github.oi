    <p>Hal Jordan... As a young man, he saw his father make aviation history before the
    tragedy will hit him. As an adult, he faced that tragedy.
    Then came the fateful day when a flight simulator test and a flash of green light
    they took him to a crashed alien spaceship, a ring... and a beginning that would lead him to the
    intergalactic fame.

        Emerald Green Lantern Dawn is the saga of Hal Jordan, from his childhood to
        his days as a test pilot. History follows the trail of his discovery of a
        great power and your learning from the use of that power that will one day make you the greatest of
        all Green Lanterns.</p>
