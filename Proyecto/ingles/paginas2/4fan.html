    <h1> The 4 Disunited Fantastics</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2> Synopsis:</h2>
    <p> The four individuals traditionally associated with the Fantastic Four,
    who obtained superpowers after exposure to cosmic rays during a scientific mission to the
    outer space, they are Mr. Fant√°stico (Reed Richards), a scientific genius and team leader,
    who can stretch his body in incredible lengths and shapes;
    the Invisible Woman (Susan "Sue" Storm), who ended up marrying Reed,
    and can make itself invisible and later project powerful force fields; the Human Torch
    (Johnny Storm), Sue's younger brother, who can generate flames, surround himself with them, and fly;
        and the Thing (Ben Grimm), his grumpy but benevolent friend, a former football star in the
        University and Reed's college buddy, as well as a good pilot, who possesses strength and
        superhuman endurance due to the nature of its rock-like skin. </p>
