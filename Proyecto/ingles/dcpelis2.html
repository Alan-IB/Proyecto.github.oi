        Superman is the most recognized and praised character of all time. Clark Kent/Kal-El is a young man
        twenty-something journalist who feels alienated by unimaginable powers. Brought to Earth years ago from
        The planet Krypton, an advanced alien planet, Clark has to deal with the big question: why
        I am here? Trained in the values of his adoptive parents Martha and Jonathan Kent, Clark will soon discover
        that having super skills means making tough decisions. But when what the world needs most
        it is stability, it suffers an attack. Will you use your skills to keep the peace or will you use them to divide and
        conquer? Clark must become the hero known as Superman, not just to shine as the last
        A ray of hope for the world but also to protect those he loves."
